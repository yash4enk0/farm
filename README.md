# Farm
Semi-automated farming system designed to manage and grow diverse crops efficiently.

# Project Overview
This project is created to monitor plant samples and support agricultural research. By analizing collected data, it helps determine the optimal conditions for plant growth.

The system includes a simple app that can be lounched locally, on a PC, providing:
* **Farm controls** for managing the setup
* **Data collection** such as photos and growth metrics
* **Automated reports** summarizing experimental results  

# Featrures
* **Environmental Monitoring:** Tracks key growth parameters such as air and soil temperature, air and soil humidity, and CO2 levels.

* **Growth Observation:** Uses a camera to monitor plant growth, providing visual data to complement environmental measurements.

* **Semi-Automated Farm Control:** Allows real-time adjustments to growth conditions through a connected system.

* **Data-Driven Optimization:** Collects and analyzes data to help farm owners identify the optimal conditions for different plant species and varieties.
